# Choose Your Own Adventure Project

This project is part of the **MTM6407 Web Development IV** course. The objective of this assignment is to create an interactive "Choose Your Own Adventure" story using Markdown files, while collaborating through Git and GitHub. The story will evolve in stages, with each team member contributing to different branches and adding their own parts to the story.

## Project Stages
1. **Setup**: The team leader creates a GitHub repository and an initial introduction (`intro.md`). Each team member clones the repository and creates their own branch.
2. **Expand**: Each member adds a choice to the introduction and continues the story in a new Markdown file.
3. **Review**: The team reviews and merges pull requests for the added sections of the story.
4. **Edit**: Small edits and additions are made to the story to enhance the content.
5. **Final Review**: A final review and merge process ensures the story is complete.

## Team Members
- **Carlos Aladim (Leader)**
- Rohit Deora
- Jatin Khanchi

Each member has contributed to the creation and development of the story in different stages, following the collaborative workflow of Git and GitHub.
