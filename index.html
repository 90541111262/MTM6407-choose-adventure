    <p> The Lost Treasure of Atlantis</p>
    <p> You take a deep breath and decide to swim toward the dark tunnel. The water grows colder as you enter, and the faint glow from your flashlight barely penetrates
        the thick darkness ahead. The tunnel narrows, and you can hear the faint sound of water dripping, echoing around you.
        
        As you venture deeper, you notice strange formations on the tunnel wallsâ€”possibly remnants of ancient technology or coral growth. Suddenly, the tunnel opens up into
        a large chamber. In the center, you see a glimmering object on a pedestal. </P>
