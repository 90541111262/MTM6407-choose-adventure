# The Lost Treasure of Atlantis

You are an explorer on a quest to find the legendary Lost Treasure of Atlantis. After years of research, you have finally pinpointed the location of the hidden entrance deep within the ocean. Armed with your diving gear and determination, you descend into the unknown.

As you swim through the eerie underwater ruins, you find yourself at a crossroads. One path leads to a dark tunnel, barely visible in the dim light of your flashlight. The other path takes you toward what appears to be an ancient stone door, covered in mysterious carvings.

What do you do next?

(Choices will be added in the next stage)

After months of braving the treacherous jungles of the Amazon, you finally arrive at the Temple of the Sun—a sacred place said to hold unimaginable riches. The air is thick with humidity, and the distant cries of wild animals echo around you. Your heart races as you push through the dense foliage and come face-to-face with the temple’s towering stone facade.

As you approach, you notice two paths diverging from the entrance. One path leads into a shadowy cave, the mouth of which seems to whisper ancient secrets. The other takes you up a steep set of stairs toward a large stone gate, adorned with golden symbols that glow faintly in the sunlight.

Which path will you choose?
